#### This package scrapes datasets from hockey-reference.com (all credit for statistics compilation goes to them!). 

#### The package is development, and right now has one dataset. This set compiles NHL game outcomes and attendance from 1990 to the end of the 2017 playoffs. 

##### If you are a Predators fan, do not call tail() on the dataset, you will be triggered
